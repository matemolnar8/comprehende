Answer questions about this review concern.

## Steps

When no question follows this paste, explain this review concern.

1. Resolve the pinned SHAs.
   Run `git rev-parse --verify 5f50618caf4f4029e5dbba2aa5e83419842b8460` and `git rev-parse --verify 73fa6a3083d3566e3fdecdab0e13391332c2643b` in this repository.
   Done when both objects exist.

2. Load the hunks.
   A hunk ref is a pointer into the live git diff at the pinned SHAs.
   For each hunk ref, run `git diff --find-renames 5f50618caf4f4029e5dbba2aa5e83419842b8460 73fa6a3083d3566e3fdecdab0e13391332c2643b -- <path>` and keep the hunk whose header matches the @@ range.
   Done when every hunk ref has a matching live hunk.

3. Answer from live git.
   Read those hunks. Use the why and the what as interpretation. Live git wins when they disagree.
   When you show code, quote the live git lines.
   Done when the answer quotes the live code.

Review concern 06 of 07: Skill and glossary (`skill`)

The why:

[#163](source:s1) asks the skill to say when to write a focus range or a note, and the glossary to define both.

The what:

A new Focus and notes section in `SKILL.md` names when to write each one, and `example.md` and the glossary show both.

Depends on:
- 01 Focus and note fields (`schema`)

Hunk refs for this concern:
- skills-next/comprehende/SKILL.md
- skills-next/comprehende/references/example.md
- docs/glossary.md
