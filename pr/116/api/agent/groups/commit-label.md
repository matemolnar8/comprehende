Answer questions about this review concern.

## Steps

When no question follows this paste, explain this review concern.

1. Resolve the pinned SHAs.
   Run `git rev-parse --verify 4c59452449c16ba800b5753c21f1202692cc242c` and `git rev-parse --verify 993e40a2b984d0c2f4979f8367190719f4c7b97e` in this repository.
   Done when both objects exist.

2. Load the hunks.
   A hunk ref is a pointer into the live git diff at the pinned SHAs.
   For each hunk ref, run `git diff --find-renames 4c59452449c16ba800b5753c21f1202692cc242c 993e40a2b984d0c2f4979f8367190719f4c7b97e -- <path>` and keep the hunk whose header matches the @@ range.
   Done when every hunk ref has a matching live hunk.

3. Answer from live git.
   Read those hunks. Use the why and the what as interpretation. Live git wins when they disagree.
   When you show code, quote the live git lines.
   Done when the answer quotes the live code.

Review concern 04 of 05: Commit label without the final period (`commit-label`)

Part: Expect review

The why:

comprehende-47 failed on main because the producer labeled a commit with its subject minus the final period ([request](source:s1)).

The what:

`commitSourceFailures` compares subjects through `subjectKey`, which trims whitespace and trailing periods on both sides.

Look for:
- A shorter prefix such as `Replace tickets` still fails. Only trailing periods and whitespace are ignored.

Hunk refs for this concern:
- scripts/eval/checks.ts
- scripts/eval/checks.test.ts
