Answer questions about this review concern.

## Steps

When no question follows this paste, explain this review concern.

1. Resolve the pinned SHAs.
   Run `git rev-parse --verify a447e3b960dc1c5434b9fbc2f45c112b1c630b1f` and `git rev-parse --verify ae5083caa9370b5f5985de1de0aa147a1afecc2e` in this repository.
   Done when both objects exist.

2. Load the hunks.
   A hunk ref is a pointer into the live git diff at the pinned SHAs.
   For each hunk ref, run `git diff --find-renames a447e3b960dc1c5434b9fbc2f45c112b1c630b1f ae5083caa9370b5f5985de1de0aa147a1afecc2e -- <path>` and keep the hunk whose header matches the @@ range.
   Done when every hunk ref has a matching live hunk.

3. Answer from live git.
   Read those hunks. Use the why and the what as interpretation. Live git wins when they disagree.
   When you show code, quote the live git lines.
   Done when the answer quotes the live code.

Review concern 12 of 18: Companion loads and installs packages (`plugin-install`)

Part: Host Control

The what:

`start` loads each installed package by file URL and reloads it on change; `install` stages an archive, then renames it into `plugins/`.

Attention (contract):
A package loads when `manifest.json` has `schemaVersion` 1 and its default export has an `id` and a `Map` of commands. The loader checks that shape rather than the SDK's classes, so a companion built from another SDK version still loads the package and matches `HostCommandError` by name and code.

Depends on:
- 09 Companion CLI and link (`companion-cli`)
- 08 Companion answers linked peers (`companion-server`)
